## Create development PostgreSQL database
	CREATE ROLE dakdak WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'dakdak';

# Deploying

<TODO: how-to-deploy-this on Heroku> 

Saving for further use; how to setup multi-line environment variable in Heroku (for eg private key):

* Save your private key / multi-file var into a file, for eg `temp.txt`
* (Make sure NOT to save that file into git)
* Execute this
* `heroku config:set DAKDAK_GCS_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat temp.txt)"`
* Profit!
